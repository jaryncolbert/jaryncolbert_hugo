Hi, I'm Jaryn (pronounced like Karen but swap in a "J"). I'm a recent Brooklyn
transplant originally from Silver Spring, Maryland. Welcome!

## Recent
Currently, I am attending the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/about),
where I am focused on gaining more
experience with front-end technologies. For
more info about what I have been up to recently, check out my [Now](/now) page.

## Career
I have worked as a software engineer since completing a B.S.E in Computer
Engineering at the University of Maryland (Go Terps!).
I spent my early career at several government contracting firms in the
Washington area, where I primarily focused on building software around the
Intelligence Community's [data exchange specifications](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/who-we-are/organizations/enterprise-capacity/ic-cio/ic-cio-related-menus/ic-cio-related-links/ic-technical-specifications), which define a set of common transport formats that aim to help
disparate agencies receive, validate, transform, and manage data from around the Community.

Wanting to expand my skillset, I joined the
Recurse Center's Spring 1 2019 batch, where I
will spend twelve weeks exploring new technologies, honing my skills, and
meeting incredibly talented developers from a variety of backgrounds.  

## Volunteering
I also believe it is important to increase the pipeline of potential
technologists, engineers, and generally curious minds. To that end, I endorse and
have volunteered with organizations that share the same goal, including
[Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/),
[Black Girls Code](http://www.blackgirlscode.com/), and
[FIRST Lego League](http://www.firstlegoleague.org/).

## Travel
In 2013, I took a five-month sabbatical from between jobs to travel South America
with the goal of learning Spanish, seeing the world, and eating all of the Peruvian
food that I could find! I spent about a month each in Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina,
and Chile. This was the single most transformative experience of my life,
as it tested my organizational skills, mental toughness, and willingness to expand
my worldview.

Since then, I try to take at least one domestic and one international trip each
year. My current count is 28 states and thirty-something countries on six continents
(I'm coming for you, Antarctica!). My last big trip was in early 2019 to
Southeast Asia, Spain and Morocco; I learned that the mass migration around
the Lunar New Year is a sight to behold,
[Mud√©jar architecture](https://www.google.com/search?q=real+alcazar+seville&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjWoNaU_LThAhUvUt8KHcDcCiAQ_AUIDigB&biw=1097&bih=646) in Southern Spain is magical,
and anything made in a Moroccan tagine can't help but be delicious.
