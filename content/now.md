I accepted a new full-time position
in November 
as a Full-Stack Developer
with [Greenhouse Software](https://www.greenhouse.io/), 
an onboarding and recruiting software company 
based in NYC.

the interview process 
at Greenhouse
was the most transparent, timely, and respectful

I wanted to be a part of bringing that magic
to as many people as possible.

The Greenhouse offices went fully remote
in mid-March. Like many people, 
I am adjusting to my "new normal": 
working from home, 
staying safe, 
and reaching out to friends and family. I'm trying to stay sane
with virtual dance classes 
from [Salsa](https://salsasalsadancestudio.com) 
and meditation/mindfulness exercises.
