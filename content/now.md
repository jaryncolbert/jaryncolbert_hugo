I am currently based in Brooklyn, NY attending the
[Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), a self-directed educational retreat
for programmers looking to improve their skills. While at Recurse, I have been
exploring my listening history via the Spotify APIs,
recreating the Sol LeWitt's conceptual art pieces
with [Processing JS](http://processingjs.org/), and dabbling in functional
programming with Elm.
My Recurse batch
(Spring 1, '19) ends in early May, and I will be pursuing a full-time gig as a
software engineer in the greater New York City area.

In my spare time, you can find me leveling up my skills on the dance floor,
either at [Salsa](https://salsasalsadancestudio.com) or
[Afrobeats](https://fit4dancenyc.com/) dance classes.
