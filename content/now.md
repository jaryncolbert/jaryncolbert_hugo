I am currently based in Brooklyn, NY attending the
[Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), a self-directed educational retreat
for programmers looking to improve their skills. While at Recurse, I have been
exploring my listening history via the Spotify APIs,
recreating the Sol LeWitt's conceptual art pieces
with Processing JS, and dabbling in functional
programming with Elm.
My Recurse batch
(Spring 1, '19) ends in early May, and I will be pursuing a full-time gig as a
software engineer in the greater New York City area.

In my spare time, you can find me leveling up my skills on the dance floor,
either at [Salsa](https://salsasalsadancestudio.com) or
[Afrobeats](https://fit4dancenyc.com/) dance classes. I am currently **obsessed** with the songs _[Journey](https://open.spotify.com/track/0qjE689Bbbv8nxmhmQQ6eM)_ by Sipprell and _[In a Spiral](https://open.spotify.com/track/52V5lBmgcqEZCtHjXtJHk9)_ by BIGYUKI ft. YEBBA. I'm looking forward to seeing Phony Ppl live at [Blue Note Jazz](http://www.bluenotejazz.com/newyork/schedule/moreinfo.cgi?id=14941) before their residency ends.
