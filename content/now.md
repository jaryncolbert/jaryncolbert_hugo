I just finished up a stint
attending the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) (RC),
a self-directed educational retreat
for programmers looking to improve their skills.
While at Recurse,
I explored my listening history via the Spotify APIs,
recreated [Sol LeWitt's conceptual art](/projects/sol-itude)
with React and P5 JS,
and dabbled in functional programming with Elm.
Check out the [Projects](/projects) page
for a full summary of all of my RC projects.

After 16 (!) weeks at RC
(a full Spring 1 '19 12-week batch
followed by the Summer 1 '19 six-week half batch),
I am currently interviewing for a full-time gig
as a full-stack or back-end software developer
in the greater New York City area.

In my spare time,
you can find me leveling up my skills on the dance floor,
either at [Salsa](https://salsasalsadancestudio.com)
or
[Afrobeats](https://fit4dancenyc.com/) dance classes.
I am currently **obsessed** with the songs
_[Journey](https://open.spotify.com/track/0qjE689Bbbv8nxmhmQQ6eM)_ by Sipprell
and _[In a Spiral](https://open.spotify.com/track/52V5lBmgcqEZCtHjXtJHk9)_ by BIGYUKI ft. YEBBA.
I'm also looking forward
to attending more free live music events
at [Prospect Park](https://www.bricartsmedia.org/events-performances/bric-celebrate-brooklyn-festival)
and [Central Park](https://cityparksfoundation.org/summerstage/)
this summer!
