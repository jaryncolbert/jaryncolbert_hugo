To gain experience working on an existing code base,
I contributed to [Recurse Faces](https://faces.recurse.com),
a flashcard application
that helps members
of the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) (RC) community
learn the names and faces of their fellow batch mates.

The app was originally created in 2017 by [Jason Owen](https://jasonaowen.net/),
a talented software developer
with whom I had the pleasure
of meeting during our stints at RC.
I added features
to enhance the styling and functionality
of the original app.

My primary contributions were:

- [#40](https://github.com/jasonaowen/recurse-faces/pull/40): Changing the CSS to make results stand out against the dark background
- [#45](https://github.com/jasonaowen/recurse-faces/pull/45): Linking correct guesses to the person's RC Directory entry
  for more information
- [#49](https://github.com/jasonaowen/recurse-faces/pull/49): Showing batch information next to names (e.g. "S'19") on correct guesses
- [#54](https://github.com/jasonaowen/recurse-faces/pull/54): Enabling easier imports for environment variables

[The code](https://github.com/jasonowen/recurse-faces) is up on GitHub,
and the app is also [available online](https://faces.recurse.com)
(_RC authentication required_).
The GIF below shows a short demo of using the app,
with the facial images and last names removed for privacy.
