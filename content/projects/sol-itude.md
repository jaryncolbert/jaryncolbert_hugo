While at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) (RC),
I was introduced to the work
of Conceptual Artist, Solomon "Sol" LeWitt.
Sol believed that the idea
behind the art
was more important
than its execution.
His set of [wall drawings](https://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/) were defined
as seemingly simple instructions
that other artists implemented
and brought to life.
These instructions were detailed enough
to describe the work,
while leaving enough ambiguity
that ensured each piece would be a bit different
each time that it was executed.

I created an app called [Sol-itude](http://www.jaryncolbert.com/solitude/)
that explored a few of Sol's works
through randomized computer-generated images.
Each image fulfills the instructions
for its specific drawing
while showing the near infinite set of results
that satisfy Sol's guidelines.
The app was built in JavaScript
with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [P5](http://p5js.org/).

I presented an overview of the project
and a demonstration of the app
at the [June 2019](https://www.recurse.com/events/localhost-lightning-talks-june-2019) installment
of RC's Localhost Lightning Talks series.
